Single PDF Chatbot 

 

Overview 

Single PDF Chatbot is a smart AI assistant that allows users to upload one PDF file and interact with it using natural language. 
Built using LangChain, Hugging Face embeddings, and the Groq API, this chatbot reads the contents of the uploaded PDF, understands the context, and provides precise and relevant answers to user queries. 

This project demonstrates the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — combining document understanding with fast and accurate language model responses. 

 

Tools & Technologies Used 

    LangChain – For connecting document loaders, retrievers, and the language model 

    Hugging Face Embeddings – To generate vector representations of text for semantic search 

    Groq API – For ultra-fast and efficient LLM responses 

    FAISS Vector Database – To store and retrieve embeddings efficiently 

    Python – Core programming language 

    Gradio – For creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface 

 

How It Works 

    PDF Upload: 
    Users upload a single PDF file through the web interface. 

    Text Extraction: 
    The system extracts all text from the uploaded PDF using LangChain’s document loader. 

    Chunking and Embedding: 
    The extracted text is split into smaller chunks for better understanding and converted into Hugging Face embeddings. 

    Vector Storage (FAISS): 
    These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database, which allows for efficient semantic search and similarity matching. 

    Question Answering (Groq API): 
    When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks from FAISS and sends them to the Groq-powered LLM, which generates an accurate, context-aware response. 

 

Example Use Case 

A user uploads a research report in PDF format. 
They can then ask questions like: 

“Summarize the main findings in this report.” 
“What methods were used in this study?” 
“Who are the main authors mentioned?” 

The chatbot processes the PDF, finds the relevant information, and returns well-structured, detailed answers. 

 


Conclusion 

The Single PDF Chatbot offers a simple yet powerful way to interact with a document through conversation. 
By integrating Hugging Face embeddings, the Groq API, and FAISS, it delivers fast, accurate, and context-aware answers from a single uploaded PDF — making it a practical tool for research, education, and business document analysis.
